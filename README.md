# ðŸŒ¿ Tic-Tac-Toe using SFML
This is my first attempt to make a finished project using C++ and SFML. Itâ€™s a simple Tic Tac Toe game featuring basic 2D graphics using textures and demonstrates game loop logic, user input handling, and simple UI with a score label. The code is organized into modules like `GameInstance` (core logic), `ScoreLabel` (UI element), and `Main` for the entry point.

Good one for those learning SFML structure and fundamental game programming!
